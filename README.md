# Pearch Digital Test

The intention of this project is to test general knowledge of python / django.

The first thing that is needed from the test, is to be able to access the solution through a public version control, I leave it to your choice. Likewise, it must be specified in the code how to execute it and thus prove that it really works.

The second thing is to develop a small frontend and backend that inserts, modifies and deletes data from various tables. For this I want to store the user's information in the best way that you can suggest me for these data that are needed:
- User information (such as name, surname, telephone number and ID number)
- Information on where you live (address, city, country and postal code)
- Academic information of the user (studies, year, city ...)
